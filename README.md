# Naive Bayes/KNN Project
By Nicholas Fullerton 


### Introduction
This Project will take a dive into Naive Bayes algorithm with K Fold Cross Validation and KNN with K Fold Cross Validation.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to evaluate four models, and find the best model that will best classify our data.

### The Models
- Naive Bayes Classifier where we bin the continous data in our features and run CategoricalNB
- Naive Bayes Classifier using only the categorical features and running BernoulliNB
- Naive Bayes Classifier using only the continuous data and running GaussianNB
- KNN Model
